Master's Degree thesis "GAN Oversampling: application of a Generative Adversarial Network to imbalanced dataset".
In this thesis GAN is used for improving classification performances in various imbalanced datasets, e.g. banknote auhentication https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication
A comparison with SMOTE package is provided (Chawla, Nitesh V., et al. "SMOTE: synthetic minority over-sampling technique." Journal of artificial intelligence research 16 (2002): 321-357).
